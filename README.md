### About

**Self Radio Helper** is a small set of scripts that makes it easy to set up your custom **Self Radio** station in GTA V (*Legacy* and *Enhanced* versions).
It automates symlink creation, manages the `User Music` folder, and simplifies adding your own music into the game.

Especially useful if you want to **save space on your Main drive**, since your music can be stored anywhere (other drives, external HDD/SSD) and linked directly to the game folder.

## Why I made this project

I created this project to:
- **Simplify storing songs on GitHub** (easy to keep, share, and version them)
- **Save disk space** on the system drive by keeping music on other drives or repositories
- Make setting up **Self Radio** fast and effortless with just a couple of scripts
