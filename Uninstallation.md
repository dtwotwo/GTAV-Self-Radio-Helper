# Uninstallation

## Steps

1. Run the script: **SymLink Uninstaller.cmd**

2. Choose GTA V version:
- [1] Legacy →
  `C:\Users\<User>\Documents\Rockstar Games\GTAV\User Music`
- [2] Enhanced →
  `C:\Users\<User>\Documents\Rockstar Games\GTAV Enhanced\User Music`

3. The script will remove the **User Music** junction folder.

4. (Optional) Restore your backup if you had one (e.g. `User Music_bak` → rename back to `User Music`).
